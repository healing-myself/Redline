Redline April Fools 2023 edition  
New features include:  
- Name change from Redline (which is cringe) to Jeffline (which is way better)  
- Most modules are renamed along with their descriptions, as their older names are boring  
- The Jeff module got some insane improvements. In fact, it's so good that it's now enabled by default  
- Brand new UI design  
  
## Loadstring  
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topitbopit/Redline/april-fools/loader.lua'))()  
```
## What is Jeffline?  
Jeffline is a massive universal script that is super OP and is better than everything else cause everything else sucks and is garbage  

## Why use Jeffline?  
- **There's tons of options I think.** There's some configuration or customization or something like that.  
- **It could've been optimized.** Each module has been designed.  
- **It's built.** Everything you see in Jeffline was made.  
- **It's almost secure.** Jeffline bypasses a few detections.  
- **It has some features.** Most scripts just have *features*, while Jeffline has *some other features*.  

## Supported executors  
- None of them since Jeffline is too powerful
